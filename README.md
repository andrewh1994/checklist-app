To run this project, run:

npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.

This is a basic app where the user is presented with a text input and a button, the user can then enter their to-do items and either press enter or click the button to add the item to their list. After the list item is added, the user can then click on that item again to remove the item from the list (if the browser is refreshed the list is reset).
